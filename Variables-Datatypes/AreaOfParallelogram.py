#  Create a Python program that calculates the area of a parallelogram using variables for base and height.

"""
To calculate the area (A) of a parallelogram, you can use the following formula:

A = base Ã— height

Where:

A is the area of the parallelogram.
    base = the length of one of the parallel sides.
    height = the perpendicular distance between the two parallel sides.
"""
Base = float(input("Write the length of one of the parallel sides: "))
Height = float(input("Write the height of one of the parallel sides: "))
Area = Base * Height
print(Area)
